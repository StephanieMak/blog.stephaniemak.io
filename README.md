> What is Open data? 
> 
> It is data that is open sourced for everyone to use freely and republish without restrictions from copyright. 
> Most of the open data are published by government and scientific research institutions. In Australia, [Public Data Policy Statement](https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aust_govt_public_data_policy_statement_1.pdf) states that the Australian Government commits to optimise the use and reuse of public data, release non-sensitive data as open by default and to collaborate with the private and research sectors to extend the value of public data for the benefit of the Australian public.
